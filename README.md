## DESCRIPTION
- This repository is a collection of some of the raspberry PI projects that I have worked on 
- These projects deal with different components such as LEDS, buttons, LCD, buzzer, servo motors, stepper motors, and DC motors

## Examples

- Here is an example of using the DC motor program:
  
1. The program waiting for the user input

<p align="center">
